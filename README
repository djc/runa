Runa
====

A statically-typed Python-like programming language.


Installation
------------

Dependencies:

* Python 2.7
* Clang (tested with 3.3)

So far, it has only been tested on 64-bits OS X and Linux.


How to get started
------------------

Type the following program into a file called `hello.rns`:

	def main():
		print('hello, world')

Make sure to use tab-based indentation; spaces are not currently supported.
Now, run the compiler to generate a binary, then run it:

    djc@enrai runa $ ./runa compile hello.rns
    djc@enrai runa $ ./hello
    hello, world

Review the test cases in `tests/` for other code that should work.
