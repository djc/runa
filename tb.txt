09:30 < djc> is there any sane way with LLVM's EH to get a kind of stack trace?
09:30 <@baldrick> chandlerc: do we insert "unreachable" after provably infinite
                  loops?
09:31 <@baldrick> djc: not sure what getting a stack trace has to do with EH?
09:31 < djc> baldrick: I would like to make my language emit Python-like
             tracebacks when there's an uncaught exception
09:32 <@baldrick> djc: OK, but getting a stack trace isn't anything to do with
                  EH
09:32 <@baldrick> djc: there's something for this IIRC, hang on

09:33 < djc> maybe I'm not using the "stack trace" term right
09:33 < chandlerc> baldrick: no clue?
09:33 <@baldrick> djc: maybe you can do something with
                  http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#int_frameaddress
09:34 <@baldrick> djc: maybe libunwind and/or the eh functions in libgcc have
                  something that can help you here

09:34 <@baldrick> chandlerc: so, should infinite loops be deleted or not?
09:35 < chandlerc> i too wimped out
09:35 < chandlerc> and lost
09:35 <@baldrick> when?
09:35 < chandlerc> dunno
09:35 < chandlerc> i didn't really argue at the time
09:35 <@baldrick> you seemed in fine form yesterday!
09:35 < chandlerc> but folks eventually caved and made llvm not delete infloops
09:35  * chandlerc glowers at nicholas and others
09:36 < chandlerc> i think nicholas agreed w/ me, but lost the argument
09:36 < chandlerc> hell, i think sabre agreed and lost hte argument
09:39 <@baldrick> djc: take a look at tb-gcc.c in gcc/ada/ from recent versions
                  of gcc
09:39 <@baldrick> chandlerc: what does gcc do?
09:40 < chandlerc> no idea

09:40 < djc> baldrick: libunwind looks interesting, thanks for the pointers
09:40 <@baldrick> djc: that file I mentioned is (a) pretty short, and (b) gets
                  the backtrace using libgcc's unwind stuff
