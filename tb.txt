09:30 < djc> is there any sane way with LLVM's EH to get a kind of stack trace?
09:31 <@baldrick> djc: not sure what getting a stack trace has to do with EH?
09:31 < djc> baldrick: I would like to make my language emit Python-like
             tracebacks when there's an uncaught exception
09:32 <@baldrick> djc: OK, but getting a stack trace isn't anything to do with
                  EH
09:32 <@baldrick> djc: there's something for this IIRC, hang on
09:33 < djc> maybe I'm not using the "stack trace" term right
09:33 <@baldrick> djc: maybe you can do something with
                  http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#int_frameaddress
09:34 <@baldrick> djc: maybe libunwind and/or the eh functions in libgcc have
                  something that can help you here
09:39 <@baldrick> djc: take a look at tb-gcc.c in gcc/ada/ from recent versions
                  of gcc
09:40 < djc> baldrick: libunwind looks interesting, thanks for the pointers
09:40 <@baldrick> djc: that file I mentioned is (a) pretty short, and (b) gets
                  the backtrace using libgcc's unwind stuff
